This is a simple example and starting point with Requests and BeautifulSoup. I hope it helps someone on their webscraping journey!
Requests and BeautifulSoup is a great starting point for webscraping. Then i suggest to move onto Scrapy, for bigger projects which may need to be maintained and 
to gather more data. Have fun!
